                    ABOUT ME<br>
                    <br>
                    My name is Mathew Barber, I completed my HNC and I’m currently studying a HND in Computing at
                    Warrington and Vale Royal College and I’m now looking to put my new skills in to practice within the
                    computer/tech world.<br>
                    I am a highly enthusiastic and motivated person, with excellent communication and interpersonal
                    skills, which I have picked up through my varying job roles among many others.<br>

                    HOBBIES AND INTERESTS<br>
                    <br>
                    I have a passion to improve myself, lean new things within the industry, doing online courses is a
                    great interest for me.<br>
                    I am a keen swimmer. I am a member of a local hockey team which helps with
                    team building and collaboration.<br>
                    I enjoy sports more widely, especially motorsports, rugby league on
                    TV or live, and I like to keep up date with international sports too.<br>
