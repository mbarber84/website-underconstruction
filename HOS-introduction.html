                <p>Harveys of Stretton Scenario
                    Harveys of Stretton is a used car supermarket based in Stretton with customers from all
                    over the UK. They sell used cars up to three years old and have an average stock of over
                    1500 cars on display at their extensive premises at any one time. They sell all makes and
                    models.
                    They use the latest industry leading technology to price check all their nearly new and used
                    cars daily to ensure that customers get a fair deal on both part-exchange deals and on the
                    cars they sell.
                    Each car is given a pre-delivery inspection and full check-up in the onsite workshop and is
                    sold with service history, specification, keys and documentation all recorded. They also
                    include a 3-month warranty which can be extended to 12 months for an additional fee.
                    Harveys of Stretton also offer finance deals on all the cars they sell and a delivery service for
                    customers from all over the country.<br>
