            <h2>Harveys of stretton was a Unit within my HND at Warrington & Vale Royal College</h2><br>
            <p>
                The purpose of the design document for Harveys of Stretton is to help in the critical analysis of the
                problems that have been found within their current system and the proposed solution, while also
                communicating the priority, time and effort, and impact of the problems. There have been several areas
                that have been identified as requiring modernization, but we will concentrate on the main problems.
                <br>
            </p>
            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
            <p>
                The areas that have been identified as complications on the current software are the car details are not
                logged on to the system correctly and the customer details are not being verified.
                By creating an application in which the fields are required to be filled in to ensure all the details
                are logged correctly and are verified.
                If the situation is to stay the same for Harveys of Stretton with the car details not being logged
                correctly this will lead to not being able to find the details, meaning poor customer service and loss
                of revenue and reputation. With the customer details if they are not verified it means the inability to
                have effective marketing and again poor customer service leading to loss of revenue and reputation.
                The application will record all of the vehicle details and store them to the database allowing them to
                be searched for when needed, it shall also record customer details correctly and store to the same
                database for ease of access and to allow better marketing.

                These two videos are a quick demonstration of the Harveys of Stretton app working<br>
                The videos show both the front-end (html,css and JavaScript) side as well as the bridging
                PHP and the back-end (mySQLi) using XAMMP.<br>
